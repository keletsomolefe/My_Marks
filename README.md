# My_Marks
Automatic retrival of grades from UP Portal (https:www1.up.ac.za)

This app was developed by students of the University of Pretoria, and is in now way an offical app.

# Installation
Download and intall the apk from (https://github.com/Noko-Rammutla/My_Marks/releases/download/v1.0/portal_marks.apk)

# Technical details, How it works?
  The application uses a HTTPS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) connection to log in to the UP Portal and requests the web page with your marks in the same way a browser would.
  If you chose to save your username and password, your credentials are protected by the android sandbox (https://developer.android.com/training/basics/data-storage/shared-preferences.html)
  which ensure that the marks are only available to the "My Marks " app running on your phone.

# Testing
Use the student number: u12345678 with password 12345678
